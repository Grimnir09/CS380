      <h1>PC Building</h1>
      <p>
          I've always enjoyed building comptuers ever since I was young. 
          My father started me out with a prebuilt computer from compusa and I would play games like Unreal Tournament and Earth and Beyond. 
          Though at the time this beast could play anything at the time, eventually, I upgraded to more modern prebuilts and then built my own.

            Ah, this was the first computer I began to modify, with Core 2 Duo and 2 Gigs of ram this was the next best thing. A year later I put a GTX 260 in this even though the overall computer preformance was garbage.

            This is my current PC and my 3rd built computer unlike the custom prebuilts above. 
            This PC was a long time need update from my previous build which was a i5/gtx 970/8GB Ram setup. 
            I spent most of this money on the case and cpu which sports a Ryzen 5 3600x and a GTX 1070 That was Donated by a friend. This was probably the best build I've ever done.
            This Hoss of a PC can run everything at the moment and is my pride and joy.
